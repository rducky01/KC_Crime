    "In this notebook I will explore the data, mold it into the proper form form defined in the table definition notebook, and load the data into the database table. This was first done in the R strict entitled KC_Crime_Miner.R. I will attempt to recreate this in python language, since my connection to the Postgres database I'm storing my data in will be established with a Python package. For this I use a package I wrote which uses the psycopg2 package as a means to connect."
